# OpenX Python Developer Internship - Task 1

To show sellers in an easy to read way, I decided to make a Flask App since it's lightweight, easy to install and I can present the sellers in HTML.
Here is a quickstart tutorial:

After installing Flask you need to set the FLASK_APP which in that case is: "task_1"
Then a "flask run" command in the working directory should do the trick.
