# OpenX Python Developer Internship - Task 1

To make a easy to read way of the sellers I decided to make a Flask App since it's lightweight and easy to install.

After installing Flask you need to set the FLASK_APP which in that case is: "task_1"
Then a "flask run" command in the working directory should do the trick.
